< Prompt and effective emergency response to the containment of damage and the rescue of lives in a natural disasters happens is essential. Polarimetric Synthetic Aperture Radar (PolSAR) images have played a key role in helping to make decisions, especially in periods of bad weather or absence of sunlight. In this context, edge detection becomes very important to extract information from PolSAR images. In this work, we are proposing three metrics, the accuracy metric (Mac), the $\text{F}_1$-score metric (Mfe), and the Matthews correlation coefficient normalized (nMcc) metric.  The metrics are proposed to quantify the influence of the information in the intensity channels of a PolSAR image on the information fusion process to detect edges.

> Prompt and effective response to natural disasters is essential. Polarimetric Synthetic Aperture Radar (PolSAR) images have been playing a key role helping on decisions in these scenarios, especially in bad weather or absence of sunlight. In this context, PolSAR images are the only source of information. In these situations the process of finding precise boundaries to determine the extent of the disaster is an important issue as PolSAR image resolutions are usually high (order of 10m). Fusion of information from the intensity channels of PolSAR images for edge detection  enhances the precision of edges presented in these images. In this work, we propose three metrics: the accuracy (Mac), the $\text{F}_1$-score (Mfe), and the Matthews correlation coefficient normalized (nMcc). These metrics quantify the influence of the information from the intensity channels of PolSAR images on the information fusion process for edge detection.

< Natural disasters such as earthquakes or flooding have great destructive power. Among the consequences are the economic and the loss of human life. Highlighting the second case's importance, prompt and effective emergency response can save most human lives. However, Natural disasters are difficult to predict with current knowledge, and technology becomes a significant problem.

> Natural disasters such as earthquakes or flooding have great destructive power. Among the consequences are the economic impact in the affected area and the loss of human lives. In the latter case, prompt and effective responses are required to reduce the number of losses as well as the precision on determining the affected area. However, current knowledge and technology can not predict natural disasters with enough time to take proper measures, which becomes a problem.

< Among consequence of the natural disasters are the collapse of debris and rapid flooding of areas cause severe damage to life requiring quick rescues to high-risk regions. Thus, the remote sensing area assists in the natural disasters emergency response requirement because prompt and efficient information is crucial for successful rescue lives. This fact implies that the remote sensing area has increased in importance for investigating information about natural disasters.
